        "Based on the financial capability of a client, they get a credit limit, i.e., the maximum amount they can spend in a month through a credit card. This is to ensure that a client is able to pay back to the company.

They also heavily bank on the delay in the repayment by a credit card holder so that they can make a profit by charging huge late payment fees. However, the latter comes with a risk. Hence, in order to assess the degree of risk a credit card company should afford to take by giving away credit cards to the general public or an organisation, they maintain data about each of their clients. By analysing the data, they can know what would be the maximum amount they won't be able to recover from their clients yet able to make a significant profit in a financial year to run a sustainable business.\n",
