        "\n",
        "To create the **Guess A Word** game, you should follow the steps described below.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 1**\n",
        "\n",
        "Store the words to be guessed in a Python tuple. Let's call it `my_words`. A tuple is an immutable collection of items. Hence, it is best to store the words and their information in a tuple. The `my_words` tuple should contain the following 10 words, their parts of speech and their meanings as shown in the image below.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src='https://student-datasets-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/project10_tuple_eg.png'>\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** Make sure that all the letters of each word are in lowercase.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, you need to create an empty tuple. Let's call it `records`. For every player, it must store a dictionary containing the player's name, count of the player's guesses and the time (in seconds) taken by the player.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 2**\n",
        "\n",
        "As the next step, you need to create a function which returns a string containing the jumbled letters of a word. Let's call it `shuffler()`. E.g., The `shuffler()` function must return either `wims` or `mwsi` or `imsw` etc. for the word `swim`.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use the `shuffle()` function of the `random` module to shuffle the letters from a word. However, you first have to convert the word into a list of letters using the `list()` function. \n",
        "\n",
        "The `shuffle()` function simply reorganises the order of the items in a Python list. E.g., if a list contains `['s', 'w', 'i', 'm']` items, then the `shuffle()` function will reorder the items as either `['w', 's', 'i', 'm']`, or `['s', 'w', 'm', 'i']` or `['i', 's', 'm', 'w']` etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then you should use the `join()` function to convert a list of jumbled letters into a word.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 3:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt a player to enter their name. You should also tell the player, the input they need to enter to stop the game midway. Then you need to create a variable to store the counts of a player's guesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, you need to note down the start time of the game using the `time()` function of the `time` module. (Recall the `NumPy II` class).\n",
        "\n",
        "Then you need to create a `for` loop which should do the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Display the jumbled letters of a word in uppercase, the part of speech for the word in uppercase and the meaning of the word in uppercase.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Take input from the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Convert the user input into lowercase.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. If the player's input is `s`, terminate the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Else if the player's guess is correct, show the `CORRECT!` message and increase player's guess count by 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Else, show the `WRONG!` message. Also, display the correct word.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immediately at the end of the `for` loop, calculate the time difference between the start time of the `for` loop and the current time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 4:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Then add the player's name, guess count and the time taken by them to guess to the `records` tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then display the time taken by the player to guess the words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then print all the words, their parts of speech and their meanings in a tabular format.\n",
