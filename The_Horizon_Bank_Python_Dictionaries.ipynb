        "\n",
        "   - 2 denotes the user is an existing customer who wants to either check their balance, withdraw some amount from their account or deposit some amount to their account.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - 3 denotes terminate the application or terminate the infinite `while` loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Prompt the user to enter either `1, 2,` or `3`. Keep prompting until the user enters the valid input. \n",
